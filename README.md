Personalized Letter Generator
This project creates invitation letters for many people using one letter and a list of names.

How to Use
Write your main letter and save it in:
Input/Letters/starting_letter.txt
→ Add [name] wherever you want the person's name to appear.

Add the names of people in this file:
Input/Names/invited_names.txt
→ Write one name per line.

Run the Python program.

After running, the final letters will be ready in this folder:
output/ReadyTosend/
→ Each file will look like: Letter_for_John.docx, Letter_for_Emma.docx, etc.

Example
If your letter says:

Dear [name], you are invited...

And the names are:

John

Emma

Then it will create:

Letter_for_John.docx

Letter_for_Emma.docx
